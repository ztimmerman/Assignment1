 b. 9 commits have been made so far, using "git rev-list --count master" as the
 command.

e. Two reasons to use branches are to prevent excess commits on the main branch
as a feature is implemented, and also to develop different features on different
branches without interfering with development of other features.

f. The difference between git log and git status is that git log shows the past
history of the commits, while git status shows the current files to be committed.

g. The command used to see the commits where "Weapon.h" was one of the committed
files would be "git log .\Weapon.h".

h. The command I would use to see commits whose commit message contains the word
"file" would be "git log --grep=file".

i. In the context of bject-oriented programming, inheritance is the ability of a
subclass to inherit behaviors from a superclass. Polymorphism is the ability for
a language to process objects differently depending on data type. Encapsulation
is the principle of making objects and functions separated into individual units
so that the code is less interdependant as a whole and more modular.
